This is the best freakin' game ever made and I DEFY you to disagree.
I disagree

# EnemyController
Controller responsible for handling enemies.

# PlayerController
Controller responsible for handling the player.  This contains hardcoded player values such as movement speed or jump velocity.

# InputController
Controller responsible for handling inputs.

# PlayerAttributes
All of the attributes of a player character, health, upgrades.  This contains all in game modifiable attributes such as max health.

Maybe move movement and stuff over here once we have decided if we want movement speed to be a changable thing.

# GameState
Parameters for tracking current game state such as completed levels, obtained items/upgrades, etc
